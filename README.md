#👋 Hi, I’m Shreya

I work on data analysis and reporting projects focused on making data cleaner, more consistent, and easier to reuse over time. Most of my work involves SQL- and Python-based analysis, dashboarding, and building structured reporting workflows.

Alongside core analytics, I also explore practical GenAI use cases where it helps with documentation, summaries, or analysis support—without replacing foundational data work.

# What I work on
- Cleaning and validating datasets  
- Writing SQL queries for analysis and aggregation  
- Building dashboards in Power BI and Tableau  
- Creating repeatable reporting and analysis workflows  
- Using GenAI tools to assist with documentation and insight summaries  

# Tools
- SQL, Python  
- Power BI, Tableau  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Cloud data platforms  
- Basic GenAI workflows (LLMs for summaries and documentation support)

### Selected Projects
- Business Operations KPI Dashboard  
- Retail & E-commerce Data Analysis  
- Python Data Processing Scripts  
- AI Documentation Assistant  

This GitHub contains examples of my analysis workflows, dashboards, and small GenAI-supported tools.
