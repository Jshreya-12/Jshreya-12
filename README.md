# Hi, I’m Shreya

I work on data analysis and reporting projects focused on making data cleaner, more consistent, and easier to reuse over time. Most of my work involves SQL- and Python-based analysis, dashboarding, and building structured reporting workflows.

Alongside core analytics, I also explore practical GenAI use cases where it helps with documentation, summaries, or analysis support—without replacing foundational data work.

## What I work on
- Cleaning and validating datasets  
- Writing SQL queries for analysis and aggregation  
- Building dashboards in Power BI and Tableau  
- Creating repeatable reporting and analysis workflows  
- Using GenAI tools to assist with documentation and insight summaries

  ## 🎓 What I studied

- 🎓 **Master’s in Computer & Information Science**  
  SUNY Polytechnic Institute | Jan 2023 – Dec 2024  

- 🎓 **Bachelor’s in Computer & Information Science**  
  Sri Indu College of Engineering & Technology | Jul 2018 – Aug 2022

  ## 🧩 Problems I’ve Worked On

- **AI Documentation Assistant** — Reduced time spent understanding and navigating large codebases by generating structured, searchable documentation using AST parsing and LLMs.  

- **Software Cost Estimation** — Standardized cost drivers and forecasting logic by consolidating historical project data into reproducible models for consistent cost estimation.  

- **Business Operations KPI Dashboard** — Solved inconsistent performance tracking by unifying operational data into a single KPI model and reusable dashboards.  

- **Customer Segmentation & Retention Analysis** — Identified early churn patterns by building cohort and retention analyses to understand customer behavior over time.
