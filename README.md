# Hi, I’m Shreya

I work on data analysis and reporting projects focused on making data cleaner, more consistent, and easier to reuse over time. Most of my work involves SQL- and Python-based analysis, dashboarding, and building structured reporting workflows.

Alongside core analytics, I also explore practical GenAI use cases where it helps with documentation, summaries, or analysis support—without replacing foundational data work.


  ## 🎓 What I studied

- 🎓 **Master’s in Computer & Information Science**  
  SUNY Polytechnic Institute | Jan 2023 – Dec 2024  

- 🎓 **Bachelor’s in Computer & Information Science**  
  Sri Indu College of Engineering & Technology | Jul 2018 – Aug 2022

   ## What my work is oriented around

- Making messy or inconsistent data usable over time, not just for one analysis  
- Ensuring metrics stay consistent when data is refreshed or reused  
- Designing reporting that answers recurring questions clearly  
- Reducing manual effort through structured, repeatable analysis  
- Using GenAI only where it improves clarity or documentation, not decision-making


  ## 🧩 Problems I’ve Worked On

- **AI Documentation Assistant** — Reduced time spent understanding and navigating large codebases by generating structured, searchable documentation using AST parsing and LLMs.  

- **Software Cost Estimation** — Standardized cost drivers and forecasting logic by consolidating historical project data into reproducible models for consistent cost estimation.  

- **Business Operations KPI Dashboard** — Solved inconsistent performance tracking by unifying operational data into a single KPI model and reusable dashboards.  

- **Customer Segmentation & Retention Analysis** — Identified early churn patterns by building cohort and retention analyses to understand customer behavior over time.
